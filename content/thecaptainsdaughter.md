I was looking through the library once - looking for Pynchon - but instead stumbled upon the Captain's Daughter. It was quite small but I figured it would be nice for some nice reading. Indeed it was. The Captain's Daughter remains one of my favorite novels.

It begins with a young confused military son I think in Russia who was pretty confused about his future. The novel is basically a coming of age story of him. I was really interested in a lot of the cultural traditions of aristocratic Russia. I think some elements are remanant of our society of course but a lot more is different such as the focus on honor and such. I guess his childhood kinda reminded me of my own? his father was absent like mine ðŸ¤·. Anyways he goes on an adventure through cold Siberia.

Our character Pyotr goes to an inn. He's really irresponsible and loses a lot of money. The person that watches him scolds him for that. Eventually he reaches the fort. He's really unfamiliar with everyone there at first but gradually gets more acclimated. He meets a girl, grows closer towards her but is later forced out by invading Central Asians. A friend he met at the inn I think helps him but he is sent to jail after the campign before being pardoned by the queen.

The book has a lot of themes related to honor and nobless oblige in general. The intention is very much the intent with most coming of age stories - to situtate the person into a narrative that aligns with the broader reproduction of society. I guess Tsarist Russia at that time wanted far more honorable subjects than the technocratic neoliberal West wants today. I'd give it an **8/10**.
